# shopify_app_analysis

The intent of the project is to describe the shopify app store data, by anwsering questions such as what are the most popular apps,  
In this project, I built a database with datasets from https://www.kaggle.com/usernam3/shopify-app-store, and then used sql to query the data, and finally visualized the result datasets in tableau.
