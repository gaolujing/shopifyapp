# shopify_app_analysis

The intent of the project is to describe the shopify app store landscape, by anwsering the following questions:
  a. what are the most popular apps in each category?
  b. what is the number of apps in each category, how about just 5-star apps?
  c. what is the distribution of apps by rating score?

To do this, I started by building a database with datasets from https://www.kaggle.com/usernam3/shopify-app-store, then used sql to query the database, and finally visualized the result datasets in tableau.

The sql scripts and the resulting datasets are uploaded here. To view the visulization of the final results, please visit my public tableau dashboard https://public.tableau.com/profile/lujing.gao#!/vizhome/ShopifyAppsAnalysis/Dashboard1.
